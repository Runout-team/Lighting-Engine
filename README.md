# Lighting Engine: Open-source for Everyone, for Everything.

Lighting Engine is an open-source game engine designed to provide a robust and modern framework for game development.\
Built with C++ at its core and support for C# scripting, this engine balances performance, flexibility, and ease of use.

## Description

Lighting Engine originates from the core foundation of Thunder Engine, the proprietary engine developed and held by Runout Team.\
While the Lighting Engine retains many of the powerful features of its predecessor, it has been adapted and streamlined to cater to public developers and open-source collaboration.

### Key features include:
- Fast Performance: Optimized for speed with a lightweight codebase.
- C++ Core: Full access to engine internals for experienced developers.
- C# Scripting: Simplified game logic implementation for faster iteration.
- Modularity: Designed with extensibility and customizability in mind.

Lighting Engine is developed with the philosophy of sharing tools to empower developers worldwide.
Development Goals

- Core Features:\
 Advanced rendering pipeline with support for Vulkan and OpenGL.
 Integrated physics engine for realistic interactions.
 Asset pipeline for efficient handling of textures, models, and animations.

- Scripting:\
 Native C++ support for performance-critical tasks.
 C# scripting for game logic, offering faster iteration and ease of use.

- Cross-Platform Support:\
 Windows, Linux, and potentially macOS.

- Open-Source Contributions:\
 Transparent development with community-driven enhancements.
